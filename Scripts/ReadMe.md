# Scripts

These are Bash scripts designed to automate the installation process. To use a script simply download it on to the Pi and then run the following commands:  

```
sudo chmod +x file.sh
```  
Then to run the file, type:
```
./file.sh
```  

Users who own early versions of the Fullnodes will just need to run script 2.
